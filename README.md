# DevOps--Linux-Bash-Scripting-Practices
This Repo has some useful practices for linux bash scripting and automation.

## Practice number 1:
Please write a program that gets a number from user and compares it with 10 (equal, upper or lower than) then prints the result.
## Practice number 2:
Get 20 numbers from input and find the maximum and minium value of them.
## Practice number 3:
Write a script that gets IP and username of a server and connect to it (if the server is pingable) and copies the /etc/passwd file to /user/home directory of the server.(If the server wasn't pingable, show an error message.)
